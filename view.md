"**Course title: Doing Practical in Groups**\**Course category:** Primary (Elementary Science)\r\n\r\n**Prerequisite:** None\r\n\r\n**Description:** Science lessons must be well organised if effective\r\nlearning is to take place. While there are many ways of organizing\r\nlessons, successful science lessons are most likely to arise from a\r\nmixture of whole class, group, pair and individual teaching. Different\r\nactivities will be best suited to different ways of grouping. This\r\ncourse will show you how to adapt your approaches to group work as you\r\ndevelop your science presentation skills.\r\n\r\n**Topics covered:** In this unit, we will focus on the role of group\r\nwork in primary science. The course will take you through:\r\n\r\n• The importance of group work in primary science. \r\n\r\n• Strategies for group work. \r\n\r\n• Planning practical work.\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\n\r\nGroup work allows children to work collaboratively. The number of\r\nchildren in a group will vary, but it should always be easily\r\nmanageable. Groups of four may be ideal for very young children, whereas\r\ngroups of six or more can work for upper primary work where the focus is\r\ndiscussion. The size of a group has to be a compromise between the ideal\r\nand what is practical given the size of the whole class.\r\n\r\nPractical work is best carried out in groups. Each child can be\r\nallocated a particular role in a group, and each member should have the\r\nchance to fully participate in the activity. Because of the limited\r\nnumber of roles available, groups larger than four can make practical\r\nwork difficult. Group work can also be useful for brainstorming or\r\ndiscussing ideas or findings. Here, larger groups can work well, though\r\nyou should make sure that less-confident children are not excluded from\r\ndiscussions. Paired work might be better when carrying out\r\ninvestigations where close observation is needed, and larger group work\r\nis not feasible. It can allow for more focused discussion than in a\r\nlarger group.\r\n\r\n**Organisational issues**\r\n\r\nHow children learn is affected not only by how you group them but also\r\nby how you organise activities. When you explain things to the children,\r\nwill you do it group by group or will you bring the whole class\r\ntogether? Will all groups be working on the same task, on different but\r\nrelated tasks, or on parts of a whole? Perhaps you will set up a\r\n\"circus\", in which all of the groups work on all of the tasks but at\r\ndifferent times, taking turns. Here are some strategies you can use:\r\n\r\n**Whole class Insert animation**\r\n\r\nAll the groups work on the same task. For example, they might discuss an\r\nobject, film or image used as part of a lesson starter, or each group\r\nmight carry out the same practical task. You need give only one set of\r\ninstructions, so it is easy for the children to be clear about what they\r\nare supposed to do.\r\n\r\n**Circus Insert animation**\r\n\r\nIn a circus, groups work on a series of short activities at different\r\ntimes. When one task is completed, groups move on to the next -- which\r\noften involves physically moving to another table. This kind of activity\r\ncan provide children with a range of different experiences in a lesson,\r\nbut it can be difficult to manage. Instructions at each station need to\r\nbe clear, and you need to be careful to make sure each changeover\r\nhappens on time.\r\n\r\n**Investigative work**\r\n\r\nInvestigative work allows children to use critical thinking while\r\ninvestigating an idea. Children can work in groups of two or three,\r\noften with two groups per table. They can work at their own pace and\r\nreceive targeted support.\r\n\r\n**Thematic group work Insert animation**\r\n\r\nThematic group work involves small groups working independently, with\r\neach contributing to the whole. Each group's work will be thematically\r\nlinked, but questions or activities will be different. For example, one\r\ngroup might carry out an internet research project, while another\r\ncarries out some practical work and a third is involved in a brainstorm.\r\nThis kind of activity lets children work at their own pace. It is\r\nimportant to try to ensure all children get a balanced experience and\r\nlearn the same things.\r\n\r\n**Strategies for grouping**\r\n\r\nHere are a few more creative ways to get children working in groups:\r\n\r\n**Think, pair, share Insert animation**\r\n\r\nFirst, ask the children to think individually about a particular\r\nquestion. Then get them to pair up and discuss their ideas. Finally,\r\neach pair is given the chance to share their ideas in a larger class\r\ndiscussion. The individual stage is likely to throw up a range of ideas\r\n-- some quite creative -- while the group discussions reinforce the main\r\nlearning objectives.\r\n\r\n**Snowball groups Insert animation**\r\n\r\nThe children initially work individually to devise a few questions\r\nrelating to a given topic. They then work in pairs and try to answer\r\ntheir partners' questions. Pairs then combine to form groups of four for\r\nfurther discussion. Finally, back in a class group, a member of each\r\ngroup reports back.\r\n\r\n**Jigsaw groups Insert animation**\r\n\r\nAllocate each small group a different aspect of a topic to brainstorm or\r\nresearch. Each group should aim to become experts in that particular\r\narea. Then shuffle the groups in such a way that the new groups all\r\ninclude a member from each of the original groups. An easy way to manage\r\nthis is to allocate each of the first groups a colour: in the second\r\nstage, every group should have a member of each colour. The new groups\r\nnow have experts in each aspect of the topic, and each can share what\r\nthey found with the others.\r\n\r\n**Roles within a group Insert animation**\r\n\r\nGroup work can be more successful when the children are allocated\r\nspecific roles to play. For example:\r\n\r\n• Recorder: takes notes and records group processes \r\n\r\n• Measurer: takes readings and measurements \r\n\r\n• Timekeeper: monitors the time spent on a task \r\n\r\n• Gopher/Runner: collects the apparatus and resources needed to complete\r\na task. Also fetches teacher if needed \r\n\r\n• Researcher: collects background information needed to complete a task \r\n\r\n• Checker: checks that facts are correct \r\n\r\n• Summariser: summarises conclusions and prepares the group's\r\npresentation to the class \r\n\r\nOften, children will naturally take on different roles within groups.\r\nHowever, there is a risk that if you allow this to happen some children\r\nwill take over, while others will be sidelined.\r\n\r\nActual roles allocated will depend on the activity as well as the size\r\nof the group: not all roles will be appropriate for every task.\r\n\r\n**Planning for practical work Insert animation**\r\n\r\nThe aim of science is to provide the best explanation of the world based\r\non the evidence available. Children can work like scientists by doing\r\ngood-quality, hands-on practical work. This type of activity helps them\r\nto acquire real scientific skills, as well as inspiring them to become\r\ngenuinely excited by science.\r\n\r\n**When planning for a science practical, consider:**\r\n\r\n• What is the learning objective? \r\n\r\n• What could be your starting point? \r\n\r\n• What questions could you ask? \r\n\r\n• What do you want the children to do? \r\n\r\n• How will they record what they do? \r\n\r\n• What are the possible outcomes? \r\n\r\n*More on planning practical science available in this Module -- PS004*\r\n\r\n**Safe Science Insert animation**\r\n\r\nWhen planning any science activity, the teacher has a responsibility to\r\nensure that children are safe at all times. Any activity should be risk\r\nassessed when planning the lesson, and any potential problems identified\r\nand minimised.\r\n\r\nA hazard is a potential source of danger. A risk is a situation\r\ninvolving exposure to that danger.\r\n\r\nThere are few science resources or activities in which the risks cannot\r\nbe effectively controlled and managed. Managing health and safety in the\r\nclassroom need not be difficult, nor should it inhibit effective and\r\nexciting science teaching.\r\n\r\nHealth and safety procedures may vary on a local or national level, so\r\nit is important to check with the school management team for the correct\r\nprocedures. Guidance is available from science teaching associations to\r\nhelp teachers identify possible risks and plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nTeachers should also use practical science activities to teach children\r\nabout hazards and risks. Children should be taught how to carry out\r\npractical work safely and effectively.\r\n\r\n**Assessment**\r\n\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam non\r\nrisus turpis.
